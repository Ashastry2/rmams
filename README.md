# rmams
R package for Matrix and Analysis Metadata Standards

Many molecular datasets are being generated across cancer types that contain multi-modal data collected from longitudinally- and spatially-related biological specimens. A major roadblock to this goal is that the data is stored in a wide variety of file formats or programming language-specific libraries, classes, or data structures. Although a wide range of experimental protocols and platforms are available, an important commonality across these technologies is that they often produce a matrix of features that are measured in a set of observations. In order to facilitate data sharing across groups and technologies, and assays, and to promote interoperability between down-stream analysis tools, a detailed data schema describing the characteristics of FOMs has been developed and will serve a standard useful for the community.
